## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Rust & Cargo**: Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can download them from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
*   **Solana CLI Tools (Optional but Recommended)**: For interacting with the Solana blockchain from your terminal. Install from [solana.com](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli).
*   **A Solana Wallet with SOL**: You'll need SOL in your parent wallet for transaction fees and funding other operations.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OctoToolsCorp/OctoTools.git
    cd OctoTools
    ```
2.  **Build the Application**:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    This will compile the application and create an executable in the `target/release/` directory.

### Running the GUI

To launch the OctoTools GUI, run the compiled executable:

```bash
cargo run --bin solana-pumpfun-token-gui # Run the GUI application
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

OctoTools uses a `settings.json` file (located in the application's working directory) to store your configurations. You can manage most settings directly from the GUI under the "Settings" view.

### Key Settings Explained:

*   **Solana RPC URL**: The endpoint for connecting to the Solana blockchain (e.g., `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`).
*   **Commitment Level**: Determines the transaction finality you wait for (`processed`, `confirmed`, `finalized`).
*   **Jito Configuration**:
    *   **Block Engine Endpoint**: Select a Jito block engine for MEV-aware transaction submission.
    *   **Jito Tip Account Pubkey**: The address to send Jito tips to.
    *   **Jito Tip Amount (SOL)**: The amount of SOL to tip for Jito bundles.
*   **Wallet & Key Management**:
    *   **Keys File Path**: The JSON file containing your loaded wallets.
    *   **Parent Wallet Private Key**: Your primary wallet's private key (used for funding, gathering, and some operations).
    *   **Dev Wallet Private Key**: A dedicated wallet for token creation/minting.
*   **Default Transaction Parameters**: Set default slippage and priority fees for transactions.

## üß≠ GUI Views Overview

*   **üöÄ Launch**: Create and deploy new tokens, configure initial buys, and manage Jito bundles.
*   **üí∏ Sell**: Execute individual or mass sell orders for tokens, with options for percentage or fixed amounts.
*   **üí• Atomic Buy**: Perform coordinated multi-wallet token purchases in a single bundle.
*   **üí® Disperse**: Distribute SOL from your parent wallet to selected sub-wallets.
*   **üì• Gather**: Consolidate SOL from multiple sub-wallets back to your parent wallet.
*   **üîç Check**: Monitor SOL and token balances across all wallets and calculate P&L for specific tokens.
*   **üîß ALT Management**: Tools for creating, managing, and deactivating Solana Address Lookup Tables.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Settings**: Configure all application parameters, including RPC, Jito, and wallet settings.
*   **üìà Volume Bot**: Set up and run automated trading simulations with customizable buy/sell logic.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

*   **Private Keys**: Your private keys are sensitive. OctoTools stores them locally in your `settings.json` file. Ensure this file is protected and never share it.
*   **Dedicated Wallets**: Consider using dedicated wallets with minimal funds for automated operations to limit potential exposure.
*   **Transaction Fees**: Always ensure you have sufficient SOL in your parent wallet to cover transaction fees.
